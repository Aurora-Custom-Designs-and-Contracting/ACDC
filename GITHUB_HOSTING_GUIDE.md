# GitHub Hosting Deployment Guide - Aurora CDC

## ðŸš¨ Important Notice About GitHub Pages

**GitHub Pages only supports static websites** and cannot run server-side PHP code. This means your secure reCAPTCHA form processor (`process-contact.php`) cannot run directly on GitHub Pages.

## Current Status âœ…

Your secure reCAPTCHA implementation has been successfully pushed to GitHub with:
- âœ… Updated HTML with reCAPTCHA v3 integration
- âœ… Complete PHP form processor with server-side verification
- âœ… Security configurations and environment setup
- âœ… Comprehensive deployment instructions

## Deployment Options for Your Contact Form

### Option 1: GitHub Pages + External Form Service (Recommended)

**For GitHub Pages deployment, you'll need to use a form service:**

#### A. Netlify Forms (Free & Easy)
1. Deploy to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages
2. Add `netlify` attribute to your form
3. Netlify handles server-side processing automatically

#### B. Formspree (Form Service)
1. Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Update your form action to: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`
3. Keep your reCAPTCHA client-side integration

#### C. Emailjs (Client-side Email)
1. Sign up at [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com)
2. Configure email templates
3. Send emails directly from client-side JavaScript

### Option 2: Host with PHP Support (Full Control)

To use your complete secure implementation, deploy to a hosting provider that supports PHP:

#### Recommended PHP Hosts:
- **Netlify Functions** (Serverless PHP)
- **Vercel** (Serverless functions)
- **Heroku** (Free tier available)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- **Traditional shared hosting** (cPanel, etc.)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (GitHub + Serverless)

Keep your static site on GitHub Pages, but deploy the PHP processor as a serverless function:

1. **Deploy static site to GitHub Pages**
2. **Deploy form processor to Netlify Functions or Vercel**
3. **Update form action** to point to your serverless endpoint

## Quick Implementation for GitHub Pages

### Temporary Solution: Use Formspree

1. **Sign up for Formspree** (free for 50 submissions/month)
2. **Update your form in index.html:**

```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST" id="contact-form">
    <!-- Keep existing form fields -->
    <!-- reCAPTCHA will work client-side -->
</form>
```

3. **Update JavaScript** to handle Formspree responses
4. **Keep reCAPTCHA** for spam protection

### For Full Server-side Control: Deploy to Netlify

1. **Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your Aurora CDC repository

2. **Configure Netlify Functions for PHP:**
   - Create `netlify/functions/` directory
   - Convert your PHP processor to a Netlify function
   - Deploy with full server-side processing

## Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Quick GitHub Pages Deployment
1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   # In your GitHub repo settings:
   # Pages â†’ Source â†’ Deploy from a branch â†’ main branch
   ```

2. **Use a form service** for contact form functionality
3. **Your site will be live** at: `https://aurora-custom-designs-and-contracting.github.io/ACDC/`

### Option B: Full-Featured Deployment
1. **Choose a PHP hosting provider**
2. **Follow your existing `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**
3. **Upload all files including the PHP processor**

## Recommended Path Forward

**For immediate deployment:** Use GitHub Pages + Formspree
- âœ… Get your site live quickly
- âœ… Maintain reCAPTCHA protection
- âœ… Professional email delivery
- âœ… No server management required

**For maximum control:** Deploy to Netlify or similar
- âœ… Use your complete secure implementation
- âœ… Server-side reCAPTCHA verification
- âœ… Custom email formatting and logging
- âœ… Full security control

## Converting to GitHub Pages Compatible

If you want to deploy immediately to GitHub Pages, I can help you:
1. **Create a Formspree integration**
2. **Update the JavaScript** to work with form services
3. **Maintain reCAPTCHA** client-side protection
4. **Get your site live today**

Would you like me to implement the GitHub Pages compatible version, or would you prefer to deploy to a PHP-compatible hosting service?
