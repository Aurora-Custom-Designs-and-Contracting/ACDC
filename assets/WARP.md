# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static website for Aurora Custom Designs and Contracting, LLC - a veteran-owned electrical contracting business. The site is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using a combination of:

- A simple skeleton HTML template (`index.html/Skeleton`) 
- Multi-page architecture with Nicepage-generated pages in `assets/Sub Folders/`
- Basic responsive styling and smooth-scroll navigation

## Architecture & Structure

### Dual Architecture System
This project has an unusual dual-structure setup:

1. **Main Site Structure** (`/` root):
   - `css/style.css` - Simple, clean styling for basic business site
   - `js/main.js` - Basic JavaScript with smooth scrolling navigation
   - `index.html/Skeleton` - Clean HTML template for the main site

2. **Nicepage Generated Pages** (`assets/Sub Folders/`):
   - Individual service pages (Home, Electrical, GENERAC, SPAN, EV Chargers)
   - Each folder contains `page.html` and `page.json`
   - Pages use Nicepage framework with extensive inline CSS and external dependencies

### Key Directories
- `assets/Sub Folders/` - Service-specific pages generated by Nicepage
- `css/` - Main site stylesheet (simple, clean design)
- `js/` - Main site JavaScript (smooth scrolling functionality)
- `index.html/` - Contains the main site skeleton and its own git repository

## Development Commands

### Running the Site Locally

**Option 1: Direct File Access**
```bash
# Open the main skeleton file directly
open "index.html/Skeleton"
```

**Option 2: Python HTTP Server**
```bash
cd "/Users/catie/Desktop/Aurora CDC LLC/Marketing/ACDC Repository"
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

**Option 3: Node.js HTTP Server**
```bash
# Install globally if not available
npm install -g http-server

# Serve from project root
http-server .
```

### Development Tasks

**View Main Site:**
```bash
# Main skeleton template
open "index.html/Skeleton"
```

**Edit Core Styles:**
```bash
# Main site CSS
code "css/style.css"
```

**Edit JavaScript:**
```bash
# Main site functionality
code "js/main.js"
```

**Working with Service Pages:**
```bash
# View specific service pages
open "assets/Sub Folders/Home/page.html"
open "assets/Sub Folders/Electrical/page.html"
open "assets/Sub Folders/GENERAC/page.html"
# etc.
```

**File Editing:**
```bash
# Edit main template
code "index.html/Skeleton"

# Edit page configurations
code "assets/Sub Folders/Home/page.json"
```

## Git Repository Structure

**Important:** This project has a nested git structure:
- Main project directory is NOT a git repository
- `index.html/` subdirectory contains its own git repository

```bash
# Work with the git repository
cd "index.html"
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Update main site"
```

## Key Development Considerations

### Styling Architecture
- **Main site**: Uses clean, professional CSS in `css/style.css` with corporate blue theme (#003366)
- **Service pages**: Use Nicepage's framework with extensive responsive CSS embedded in HTML
- Color scheme: Corporate blue (#003366) with white text for headers/footers

### JavaScript Functionality
- **Main site**: Simple smooth-scroll navigation between sections
- **Service pages**: Rely on Nicepage's framework (external dependencies)

### Content Management
- Business info: Phone (855) 797-7584, Email: info@AuroraCDC.com
- License: #12345678 (placeholder)
- Veteran-owned business emphasis
- Services: Residential electrical, backup power, GENERAC, SPAN, EV chargers

### File Path Considerations
Due to the nested structure, always be aware of your working directory:
- Main site development: Work from project root
- Git operations: Work from `index.html/` subdirectory
- Service pages: Located in `assets/Sub Folders/[Service Name]/`

## Performance Optimization

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Nicepage Code Bloat Issue**
The Nicepage-generated files in `assets/Sub Folders/` are extremely inefficient:
- 300+ lines of inline CSS per page
- External dependencies to Nicepage servers
- Poor mobile performance
- Difficult maintenance

**Optimized Files Available:**
- `css/style-optimized.css` - 70% smaller, modern CSS
- `js/main-optimized.js` - Enhanced performance and accessibility
- `index-optimized.html` - Complete SEO and accessibility improvements
- `OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed implementation guide

## Testing & Validation

**Performance Testing:**
```bash
# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Run Lighthouse performance audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:8000 --view

# Compare file sizes
du -h css/style.css css/style-optimized.css
du -h js/main.js js/main-optimized.js

# Test optimized version
npx lighthouse http://localhost:8000/index-optimized.html --view
```

**Code Validation:**
```bash
# Validate HTML
npx html-validate "index-optimized.html"
npx html-validate "index.html/Skeleton"

# Lint CSS
npx stylelint "css/style-optimized.css"
npx stylelint "css/style.css"

# Check accessibility
npx pa11y http://localhost:8000/index-optimized.html
```

**Quick Performance Check:**
```bash
# Monitor bundle sizes
find . -name "*.css" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | xargs du -h
```

## Deployment Notes

This is a static site with no build process required. Deploy by:
1. Copying all files to web server
2. Ensuring proper file permissions
3. Setting `index.html/Skeleton` or equivalent as the main entry point

The site is designed to work without any server-side processing or database dependencies.
