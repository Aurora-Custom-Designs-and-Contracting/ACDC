## Technical Details

### Server Configuration
Your Node.js server (`server.js`) is properly configured to serve static files including images.

### File Structure
```
AuroraCDC/
├── images/           (177 files)
├── index.html        (main page)
├── Business-Website/ (subdirectory pages)
└── server.js         (Node.js server)
```

### Image Path Patterns
- Main page: `images/filename.ext`
- Subdirectory pages: `../images/filename.ext`
- CSS files: `url("images/filename.ext")`

## Conclusion

**All image issues have been resolved.** Your website should now display all images correctly both locally and when deployed. The main issue was a missing social media meta tag image which has been fixed.

If you continue to experience image loading issues, check:
1. Browser cache (hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. File permissions on your server
3. Network connectivity
4. Content Security Policy headers (already configured in your server.js)
